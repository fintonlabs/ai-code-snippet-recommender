# The tool should be able to take a natural language query, process it using NLP techniques, search a code repository, and recommend relevant code snippets based on the query

## Overview :book:
The Code Search Tool is a resourceful utility designed to simplify the process of searching for relevant code snippets in a local repository. Given a natural language query, this tool leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand the context of the search and provide the most relevant code snippets from the repository. It eliminates the need for manual search and makes code reuse easier, thus improving coding efficiency and reducing development time.

## Features :bulb:

- **Natural Language Query Processing** :speech_balloon:  
  The tool accepts queries in natural language, adding a layer of user-friendliness and convenience to the code searching process. This feature allows developers to describe what they’re looking for in their own words, reducing the need for specific syntax or keywords.

- **NLP Techniques Utilization** :brain:  
  The tool uses advanced NLP techniques to understand and process the natural language queries. These techniques help in accurately interpreting the context of the user's query, ensuring that the search results are as relevant as possible.

- **TF-IDF Vectorization** :bar_chart:  
  The tool employs the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorizer to transform text into a meaningful representation of numbers which is used to compute the relevance score of each code snippet. TF-IDF emphasizes the importance of less common words – those that may give more insight into the context of the user's query.

- **Cosine Similarity for Relevance Scoring** :triangular_ruler:  
  The tool uses cosine similarity, a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors, to calculate relevance scores. This helps in ranking the code snippets based on their relevance to the user's query.

- **Local Repository Support** :file_folder:  
  The tool supports searching within a local repository of code snippets. This provides the advantage of offline usage and quick search results. The repository path is specified during the initialization of the tool.

- **Code Snippet Loading** :scroll:  
  The tool efficiently loads code snippets from the local repository to memory during the initialization process. This aids in quicker search and retrieval of code snippets. The loaded code snippets are stored in a dictionary where keys are file names and values are the code snippets.

```

Replace `'/path/to/your/repository'` with the actual path to your repository.

Now, you are ready to use the CodeSearchTool to search your code snippets using natural language queries!

# Code Search Tool User Guide

The `CodeSearchTool` is a Python-based tool that allows you to search a local repository of code snippets based on natural language queries. This tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process the queries and recommend relevant code snippets.

- [Common Use Cases](#common-use-cases)
- [Parameters](#parameters)
- [Expected Outputs](#expected-outputs)
- [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage)

## Basic Usage

Below is a basic example of how to use the `CodeSearchTool`:

```python
from CodeSearchTool import CodeSearchTool

# Initialize the tool with the path to the local repository of code snippets.
tool = CodeSearchTool("path_to_your_local_repository")
```

At this point, the tool will have loaded all code snippets from the provided local repository.

## Common Use Cases

The most common use case for this tool is to search for relevant code snippets based on a given query. This is done by passing the query string to the `search` method of the `CodeSearchTool` instance.

```python
results = tool.search("sort a list in python")
```

The `search` method will return a list of the most relevant code snippets sorted by their relevance scores.

## Parameters

The `CodeSearchTool` class has the following parameters:

- `repository_path` (str): The path to the local repository of code snippets. This is a required parameter.

## Expected Outputs

The `search` method returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains a file name and a relevance score. The list is sorted in descending order of relevance scores. 

```python
results = tool.search("sort a list in python")
print(results)

# Expected output
[('sort_list.py', 0.87), ('list_operations.py', 0.76), ('utilities.py', 0.45), ...]
```

Each tuple represents a code snippet from the local repository. The first element of the tuple is the file name of the code snippet, and the second element is the relevance score of the code snippet with respect to the given query. A higher relevance score means that the code snippet is more relevant to the query.

## Advanced Usage

In addition to basic usage, the `CodeSearchTool` can be extended to support more advanced use cases. 

For example, you can customize the tool to use a different vectorizer by modifying the `vectorizer` attribute of an instance of `CodeSearchTool`.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

tool = CodeSearchTool("path_to_your_local_repository")
tool.vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')

results = tool.search("sort a list in python")
```

In this example, the `CountVectorizer` is used instead of the default `TfidfVectorizer`. This changes the way the tool processes and ranks the code snippets based on the given query.
